# Issue: 

1. NPM can't find package.json.

2. Container failed to start and isn't responding on port 8080. (or expected port.)

# sloution to reslove this issue :

# 1. NPM can't find package.json.

The error could be due to two reasons:

# 1.You do not have the package.json

To troubleshoot the first cause, we need to create a package.json using : npm init 

```bash
  - script: |
    npm init -y
  displayName: 'Initialize npm project'
  
```
# 2. You have the package.json, but you are running npm start in the wrong folder 


To fix the second cause, make sure the folder you are running the npm start command is the same folder as the package.json

# 3 . check package.json file in deployment artifacts

# 4. if the package.json file is already created in the project directory then there is a possibility that you are not running your project from the right path. 

Use cd your-project-path in the terminal and then run your project from there.


# 5. using a very old version of Node.js it shows "no such file or directory package.json"

# 6. Clean your npm cache

# 7. check startup command , typically npm start

# 8. test locally  once.

# 9. windows /ubuntu compabailty issue.

# 2. Container Startup:

# Issue: Container failed to start and isn't responding on port 8080. (or expected port.)
Fix: Check if your application is correctly set up to listen on port 8080 and that the Docker configuration is correct.
